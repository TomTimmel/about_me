<h2> Bio </h2>
  <p>I am  a student in the Codefellows Bootcamp working towards a career in coding and web development. Prior to returning to school, I enjoyed a successful career in business management. I believe that my previous experience augmented by the newly learned skills I am aquiring at Codefellows will make me a valuable addition to a development team!</p>
